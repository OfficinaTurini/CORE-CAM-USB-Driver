# CORE-CAM-USB-Driver
This archive includes the USB driver for CORE-CAM. This driver has been developed and tested in Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2010.
OpenCV 3.2 and FTDI libraries are required. 
Theoretically, the entire library can be compiled for a different operating system. 
Inside there are also all binaries ready to use.
